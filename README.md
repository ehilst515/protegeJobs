# protegeJobs

Proof of concept to source junior roles for protege.dev

## Method

I'm initially following the [CSS-Tricks guide to parse RSS feeds](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-fetch-and-parse-rss-feeds-in-javascript/). This seems to be the fastest route to MVP since RSS normally updates every 12 hours. The RSS feed targeted is the [Career Jet RSS](https://www.careerjet.com/partners/rss.html) filtered to junior software developer roles.
